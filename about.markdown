Rachel Switzer is a Software Consultant Lead & Architect based in Austin, Texas, specializing in Microsoft technologies and enterprise solutions. Over the course of her career, she has worn many hats—Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, and even Solution Architect in sales—giving her a unique perspective that bridges technical execution with business strategy. This breadth of experience allows her to design solutions that are not only technically sound but also aligned with organizational goals.

Her career highlights include recognition as Consultant of the Year (2020) and Consultant of the Quarter (2019) at Magenic, reflecting her ability to lead complex projects and deliver results that exceed expectations. Rachel holds multiple certifications — underscoring her commitment to staying at the forefront of evolving technologies.

Beyond her technical work, Rachel is deeply invested in mentorship and community service. She volunteered for six years with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Texas, five years with Meals on Wheels, contributed her time to Girls Who Code, and volunteered for AnitaB.org, championing diversity and inclusion in technology. Her dedication to service mirrors her professional ethos: building solutions that empower people.

When she’s not architecting enterprise solutions, Rachel loves spending time with her husband and three dogs. She enjoys gardening, beading, and silversmithing jewelry, creative outlets that balance her life outside of tech.

Rachel earned her degree in Computer Science from Stephen F. Austin State University, where she was named Computer Science Student of the Year (2007). Today, she continues to champion innovation, collaboration, and lifelong learning—whether building enterprise solutions, mentoring technologists, or cultivating her garden.
